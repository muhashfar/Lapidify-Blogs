**Magnifying glasses** are mentioned in the writings of Roman philosiphers **Seneca** and **Pliny** the Elder, Roman philosophers during the first century AD. The earliest simple microscope was merely a tube with a plate for the object at one end, and, at the other, a lens that magnified an object up to ten times its actual size. The development of the conventional microscope at the end of the 17th century would lead to a great step forward for science, particularly in biology and medicine.

The _first scientific results based on microscopy dealt with the circulating blood system_, and changed our biew of human body. By using microscopes, scientists were able to discover the existence of microorganisms, study the structure of cell, and see the smallest parts of plants, animals, and fungi. Today, the microscope is still a commonly used tool to diagnosis illness in hospitals and clinics.
